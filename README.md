‘Technium’ is a term coined by futurist and author Kevin Kelly. Technium refers to everything which humans have thought of and produced over time.

Apart from the six fundamental kingdoms of nature, Technium - The Kingdom of Technology has silently emerged to the point where it has gained enough potential to overpower and topple the currently dominating kingdoms.

The objective of the project would be to study and analyze the evolution of technology over the past few decades.

The research paper aims to elaborate the concept of “Technium”, explained by the futurist Kevin Kelly. Henceforth, we will discover the similarities and differences of this seventh kingdom from the rest and try to predict the future prospects of this study.
